# What I have learned from this course

So far, I’ve learned how to create pull requests, commit changes, and manage my workflow with Git and GitHub. I now understand how to track changes, 
collaborate with others, and contribute effectively to repositories. Each step—from staging files to opening a pull request—feels more intuitive now. 
It’s exciting to see version control become second nature.
