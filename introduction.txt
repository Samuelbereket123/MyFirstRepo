#Brief Introduction About Myself

I'm Samuel Bereket, a passionate and driven individual who’s always exploring new ways to solve real-world problems through technology. I enjoy building things from the ground up—whether it's coding projects,
startup ideas, 
or anything that challenges me to think creatively and work hard. I believe in learning by doing, and I’m not afraid to fail if it means growing. I'm focused, 
adaptable, and always pushing myself to improve—not just as a developer, but as someone who wants to make a meaningful difference.
